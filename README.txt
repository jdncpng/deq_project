in our digital enterprise course last 4th semester, we conducted a study to explore the impact of technostress on data scientists. This was done by measuring the effect of  information and communication technologies (ICTs) on job performance and job satisfaction. We examined the correlation between technostress factors—such as Usefulness, Conflicts, Insecurity, Overload, and Unreliability—and job satisfaction and performance.

The project involved 35 employees working in the field of AI, Machine Learning, Data
Science or similar fields. A survey was administered to collect data on how working with ICTs
are affecting stress levels of participants, and to measure the outcomes due to the stressors.

Survey was distributed through 3 main ways:
1. connecting through LinkedIn. Keywords such as “data”, “machine learning”, “AI” and
similar connotations were used in the search bar, filtered out people situated in “Berlin,
Germany”, and then sent a connection if they are currently employed. If connection was
accepted, a message was sent to invite them to fill up the survey
2. reaching out to personal contacts. That includes informally inviting university professors or
family relatives to fill out the survey and requesting to forward it to their coworkers
3. reaching out to companies in berlin.

of the 35 participants, mean age is 32.97. 24 (68.6%) are Male, 11 (31.4%) are female.
The majority of them have a contractual weekly working time of 40 hours. Students mainly
used robust methods in analyzing the predictors, control variables and outcomes.

The findings indicate that job performance and job satisfaction are not significantly
influenced by the stressors examined.
